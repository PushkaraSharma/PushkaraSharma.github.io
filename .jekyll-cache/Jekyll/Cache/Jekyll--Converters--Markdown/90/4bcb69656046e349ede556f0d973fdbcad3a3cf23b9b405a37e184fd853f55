<p>Trust me, if you want to go a long way in this field than it is <strong>unavoidable</strong>. Consider it as an advanced form or more detailed version of the <strong>readme file</strong> that you make for your <strong>GitHub</strong> projects that will allow your project (open source) to reach more audiences and get a better understanding of your project.</p>

<p>Yes!! I know writing concise and clear technical blogs takes practice but trust me the knowledge you share will help a lot of folks.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:-</strong> Most of the people will say to start your own blogging website, in some cases, this will be beneficial(earning money through ads) but if you really want to share your knowledge then go for renowned platforms like <strong>Medium</strong>.Tell me who wants to see those ads while learning something. Thatâ€™s the reason for the success of Medium(no ads).</p>

<p>So, here are some of the benefits of writing blogs that will boost your data science portfolio.</p>

<h2 id="enforce-learning">Enforce Learning</h2>

<p>Writing about what you have learned recently or explaining the working of the project and underlying maths of the algorithms will help you to remember it in the longer run. Also writing the learning in your words will help you to recall it quickly by just skimming through the article.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-sharing">Knowledge Sharing</h2>

<p>Sharing code with others is not enough. They must understand why you have used a certain algorithm and other technical stuff in order to understand the underlying working of your project. So, that they can implement that without any hurdle or even contribute and improve your existing project. This gap can be filled by writing an article.</p>

<p>Also, sharing your solution to a particular problem can be in the form of an answer to StackOverflow or Quoraâ€™s question.</p>

<h2 id="gratitude-and-contribution-to-open-source">Gratitude and Contribution to Open Source</h2>

<p>This field of Data Science is mostly driven by open source or free to use materials whether it is projects like scikit-learn, free courses, youtube videos, or maybe StackOverflow answers. And all of us including you are helped a lot by these materials. So consider it as our duty, we must contribute to the world of <strong>Open-Learning</strong>(Free). You can write about anything that you have learned recently or about those topics or problems which are not answered yet on StackOverflow or maybe your thoughts like this particular article.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-with-more-data-science-enthusiasts">Connecting with more Data Science Enthusiasts</h2>

<p>Before I started writing, I barely know (other than my university friends)people who are into Data Science although I was doing some projects, pushing code on Github. So, writing articles on world-renown platforms like <strong>Medium</strong> will help you to connect with people of the same interest. Maybe one of your readers will hire you ðŸ˜†.</p>

<h2 id="improved-documentation-skills">Improved Documentation Skills</h2>

<p>This one is very important. We all know about the importance of documentation. Freshers always rush to build some great projects but lack in its presentation. In the corporate world, documentation is given almost the same importance as code itself. For example:- How will you run any project, if you donâ€™t know how to run it? So this skill of writing good documentation can be easily developed by writing articles about your projects.</p>

<hr />

<p>So, these were some of the benefits that I think every Data Scientist must avail by writing blogs.</p>

<p>Everyone has learned something that is worth <strong>SHARING</strong>! So, stop hesitating <strong>START SHARING</strong>. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>

<p>This is my first article that doesnâ€™t have any code involved. Please let me know if you liked it or not.</p>
